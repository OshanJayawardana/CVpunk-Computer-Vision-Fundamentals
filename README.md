# CVpunk - Tutorial Set for Learning the Fundamentals of Computer Vision

![preview](https://github.com/OshanJayawardana/CVpunk-Computer-Vision-Fundamentals/blob/main/resources/preview.png)

This repository is developed to help students who are newly stepping into the field of Computer Vision. You can find the codes which are essential to learn the fundamentals, explained line by line. These tutorials are inspired by the `Fundamentals of Image Processing and Machine Vision` lectures conducted by [Dr. Ranga Rodrigo](https://github.com/rangarodrigo) at University of Moratuwa. [Here](https://github.com/rangarodrigo/EN5204Code) you can find the resource repository I referred when creating these tutorials.
